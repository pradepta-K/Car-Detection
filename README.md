# Car Detection
This project uses fundamental tools provided by OpenCV fo object detection and tracking. In this project a video of a highway is used as a test for detecting objects in aparticular area of interest. Techniques like background subtraction is used to extract the moving object from the static background. After that thresholding and masking is used to clean the frames and subsequently used for object detection.
